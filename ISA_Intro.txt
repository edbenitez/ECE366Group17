1. Introduction. This should include the name of the architecture, overall philosophy,
specific goals strived for and achieved.

2. Instruction list. Give all the instructions, their formats, opcodes, and an example.

3. Register design. How many registers are supported? Is there anything special about the
registers?

4. Control flow (branches). What types of branches are supported? How are the target
addresses calculated? What is the maximum branch distance supported? Give examples
of your assembly branch instructions and their corresponding machine code.

5. Data memory addressing modes. What addressing modes are supported for data
memory? How are the addresses calculated? Give examples of your assembly load / store
instructions and their corresponding machine code.
